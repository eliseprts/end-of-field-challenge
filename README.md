## Self-Evaluation Criteria


### Git

- [ ] We have created the repository
- [ ] I commit regularly with [useful commit messages](https://www.google.com/search?q=useful+commit+messages&oq=useful+commit)
- [ ] I push to the repository often (at least twice a day)
- [ ] I provide a README, briefly describing the project

_Example of good commit messages:_

- Add interface 1 HTML structure
- Add basic styling for interface 1
- Fix CSS centering problem
- ...

### HTML

- [ ] My HTML code is valid (check with an [online validator](https://validator.w3.org/))
- [ ] Every Lighthouse criteria is equal or more than 90
- [ ] My HTML code is semantic, for example:
  - I use the correct header tag (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, ...) to mark titles and subtitles (but _not_ just to make text bigger)
  - I use a `<table>` tag _only_ to display tabular data
  - I use a `<ul>`/`<ol>` tag _only_ to display lists
  - I use layout tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) _only_ for page-wide sections
- [ ] My HTML code is well indented (if necessary I use an automatic formatter such as Prettier)
- [ ] My HTML is accessible (every `<img>` has a well written and descriptive **alt** attribute)

### CSS

- [ ] My CSS is well organized and indented (use an automatic formatter such as Prettier)
- [ ] My CSS has relevant media queries to make the interface responsive (I test it on mobile, tablet and desktop width)
- [ ] My classes are named in a meaningful way
  - Note: there are 1000 ways to name your classes, you will not be judged on the specific name you choose, but we can see if you chose something random vs. something that makes sense :)
- [ ] My CSS produces consistent results on Chrome and Firefox

### Overall result

- [ ] My end result visually matches the provided mockup to the best of HTML/CSS possibilities
- [ ] I use a font whose category matches the font in the provided mockup (where _category_ means **serif**, **sans-serif** or **monospace**)
  - Extra points if you can actually find a similar font, for example on Google Fonts
- [ ] I use colors that match the colors found in the provided mockup (using a color picker if necessary)
  - I use correct colors for fonts
  - I use correct colors for backgrounds
  - I use correct colors for borders
- [ ] I accurately reproduce the overall dimensions of the widget, the dimensions of the inner elements, the spacing (horizontal and vertical) between the inner elements
- [ ] I size the fonts as closely as possible to the provided mockup
- [ ] I style the fonts with the appropriate weight (**normal** or **bold**) and style (**regular** or **italic**) as per the provided mockup

### Deploy

- [ ] My work is deployed and viewable by anyone with a public URL
- [ ] Each of my interface is a separate page linked to my README file
